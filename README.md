# NLP---Word-Sense-Disambiguation
This is an assignment for the course Computational Semantics at the University Paris Cite'. We use WordNet and Lesk algorithm to disambiguate words in a sentence.

The TWA file contains the necessary classes for the Lesk algorithm. 
The utils file contains the necessary functions to read the data and to compute the accuracy of the algorithm.
The processed data is stored in the TWA-sensetagged folder.

To use the algorithm, run the following command in the terminal:
```python wsd.py <path_to_TWA_data>```
